INSTALLATION:
-------------
Unzip the contents of this zip file into one directory. There is no setup or
other installation needed.

On the ZVG, the jump COLOR must be removed from J3 on the ZVG. (COLOR is a
misprint, this jumper changes the protocol used to talk with the ZVG. ZVGEmu
uses a simpler protocol and must have the COLOR jumper removed.) Power must
be cycled on the ZVG after removing the COLOR jumper.

==============================================================================

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
---------------------
When you launch the first time, if you don't specify a "-romdir", it'll
prompt you with a tree dialog for where your roms are and will never
prompt you again. Here are the command line options:

-romdir d:\roms\file

Specify the ROM directory.

-zvg

Turn on ZVG output. 

-dib

Turn on "device independent bitmap" mode. This causes ZVGEmu to run in
windowed mode.

-raster

Turn on rasterized version of the vectors being displayed. This is a
sticky option and will be remembered the next time you run ZVGEmu.

-noraster

Turn off rasterized version of the vectors being displayed. The onscreen
display functions will still work. This is a sticky option and will be
remembered the next time you run ZVGEmu.

-color

Drive all 3 color guns. Without this option, it is assumed B&W mode.

-nojoy

Turn off joystick support. Joystick support is enabled by default.

-nomouse

STARTING THE PROGRAM:
---------------------
To run the DOS ZVG emulator, type 'run_bw' for B&W monitors, or 'run_co' for
color monitors. This calls a DOS batch file that sets the correct environment
variables for DZVGEMU.EXE, and adds the command line options for a ZVG with
a B&W or color monitor attached.

Have fun!
