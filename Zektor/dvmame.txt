Readme file for VectorMAME 0.81 SDK Version 1.1a

Installation Instruction for Setting up VectorMAME.

These instruction assume the "D:" drive is your CD rom, if not,
substitute the D: with your CD rom's drive letter.

These instruction assume the "C:" drive is your Harddisk, if not,
substitute the C: with your Harddisk's drive letter.

To run VectorMAME on your DOS PC do the following:

   XCOPY D:\dvmame081s11a\ C:\VMAME\ /s /e
   
You will need to then copy your ROM images to the \VMAME\ROMS directory
and your samples to \VMAME\SAMPLES directory, or use the MAME command line
switches to point to your own directories.

                       Running VectorMAME
                       ------------------

The file MAME.CFG has been included, this file has been setup with
its parameters optimized for VectorMAME. It displays to only the
Raster Monitor by default. Once VectorMAME is running properly, and
you've setup a 'ZVGPORT=' variable (see below), use the -ZVG option
to turn on the ZVG display.

A new parameter '-ZVG n' has been added to the command line of DVMAME:

   -zvg 0  = Do not use the ZVG
   -zvg 1  = Use both the ZVG and Raster Display
   -zvg 2  = Use only the ZVG display
   -zvg 3  = Vector only displayed on ZVG, raster menu still functional
   
(For more info see the section below called: "The -ZVG Command Line Option")
   
A new environment variable must be setup before using the ZVG:

   set ZVGPORT=Pxxx Dx[,t] Ix Mx
   
   Where:
      Pxxx = ECP port address (in HEX).
      Dx,t = DMA channel of port (the ',t' is optional).
      Ix   = IRQ of the port.
      Mx   = Monitor type.
      
(For more info on "ZVGPORT=", see the following section.)
  
---------------------------------------------------------------
   
               The 'ZVGPORT=' Environment Variable
               -----------------------------------
               
The ZVG device drivers obtain their parallel port information from
the environment variable 'ZVGPORT='.  This variable indicates the
address of the ECP connected to the ZVG, it indicates the DMA channel
and the IRQ level used, and it indicates the type of monitor connected
to the ZVG.  To setup the 'ZVGPORT=' environment variable, type the
following from the DOS command prompt, or add it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file:

   set ZVGPORT=Pxxx Dx[,x] Ix Mx
   
   Where:
      Pxxx   = The address of the ECP port in hex.
            
      Dx[,t] = The DMA channel the ECP port is set to, and the type
               of DMA to use (the ',t' is optional and defaults
               to '1' if not given).
               
      Ix     = The level of interrupt used by the ECP port.
      
      Mx     = The type of monitor connected to the ZVG.
      
     
Pxxx
----
The port address of the ECP is given by the 'Pxxx' parameter.
'xxx' is the address used by the ECP port in hexidecimal.  The best
way to determine the address is to go into your PC's BIOS setup menu
(Many PC's require you to hold down the DEL key while booting to get
to this screen, though your PC may differ.) Once in the BIOS setup
menu verify that your parallel port is set to the ECP mode. Write down
the address, DMA and IRQ settings. Use these setting to setup the
'ZVGPORT=' parameters.


Dx[,t]
------
The 'Dx' parameter indicates the DMA level, the optional ',t' extension
indicates the type of DMA to use, and is only needed in the off chance the
default settings do not work.

The 'x' DMA value is a number between 0 and 3 and indicates the DMA level
of the ECP port connected to the PC.

The ',t' value is optional and is a number between 0 and 2.

   0 = No DMA, this will cause the ZVG to run slower. Use as a last resort.

   1 = Normal DMA mode. This is the default if not given.
   
   2 = Single Mode DMA. This should be tried only if the default settings
       don't work. Some older PC's may need this setting.
       

Ix
--
The 'Ix' parameter indicates the Interrupt level used by the ZVG. Set this
to the interrupt level given by your BIOS.


Mx
--
The 'Mx' command tells the ZVG what type of monitor you are using so that
it can do Color to B&W conversions, and flip the screen if neccassary.

The 'x' value indicates the type of monitor is determined by adding the
following values together:

   1  = Flip X axis
   2  = Flip Y axis
   4  = Use spot kill logic
   8  = B&W Monitor connected to ZVG.
   16 = Disable Overscanning.
   
For a B&W monitor that incorporates a spotkiller:

   4 (spotkiller) + 8 (B&W) = 12 = M12
   
So M12 would be used to drive such a monitor.

For a similar color monitor:

   4 (spotkiller) = M4
   
So M4 would be used to drive a color monitor that incorporates a
spotkiller.

***** EXAMPLES *****
--------------------

ECP Address = 378, DMA = 3, Interrupt = 7, WG Monitor:

    set ZVGPORT=P378 D3 I7 M4
    
This indicates the ECP is connected to address 378, and uses DMA
channel 3, and IRQ 7, and is connected to a color Monitor that
incorporates a spotkiller.

ECP Address = 378, DMA = 3 (Default Mode), Interrupt = 7, WG Monitor:

    set ZVGPORT=P378 D3,2 I7 M4
    
Same as above, but attempts to use DMA mode 2 (Single Mode), on the
assumption the default DMA mode was not working.

ECP Address = 378, DMA = 3 (disabled), Interrupt = 7, WG Monitor:

    set ZVGPORT=P378 D3,0 I7 M4
    
Same as above, but does not use DMA. This will slow down the speed
at which the ZVG can draw vectors and may cause the framerates to
drop. However some PC's might not support DMA and this option can
allow them to work with a ZVG.

ECP Address = 378, DMA = 3 (Default Mode), Interrupt = 7, G05 Monitor:

    set ZVGPORT=P378 D3 I7 M12
    
Same as first example but indicates a B&W monitor is being used.
Here's a list of common monitor types and their numbers:

    M4  = Color Monitors (G08's, WG's, Amplifones)
    M12 = B&W Monitors (G05's, 19V2000's)
    M29 = The Vectrex Monitor.

                    The -ZVG Command Line Option
                    ----------------------------
                    
The parameter enables the ZVG display board. You can display to both
the Raster Monitor and the ZVG, or just the ZVG, or disable the ZVG
display only to the Raster Monitor. Displaying to the ZVG only, can
significantly speed up framerates on some computers, however when you
choose to display to the ZVG only, you do not have access to the normal
MAME configuration windows. You should do your configurations before
turning off the raster display. The options are:

   -ZVG 0   = Do not use the ZVG.
   -ZVG 1   = Display on both ZVG and Raster monitors.
   -ZVG 2   = Use the ZVG only (No raster display).
   -ZVG 3   = Display vectors on ZVG only, raster menus still work.
   
The ZVG command is also available as a parameter in MAME.CFG under the
[config] option, for instance:

   [config]
   zvg = 1
   
would display to both the ZVG and Raster Monitor.

Changing the resolution can also help with the framerates when displaying
to a Raster Monitor. To allow faster framerates, and also allow MAME's on
screen displays, try setting the resolution to "-r 320x200", and use
"-ZVG 1" to enable both the ZVG and Raster monitors.

The fastest option is '-ZVG 2' this displays nothing to the raster screeen
which is one of MAME's biggest bottle necks when emulating vector games.
