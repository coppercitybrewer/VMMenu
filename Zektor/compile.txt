Instructions on compiling mame096s into DVMAME.EXE:

All the following files can be found on the original ZVG utilities
disk in the '\Zips' directory. They are also available from their original
sources:

   http://www.mame.net/zips/djgpp-gcc343.zip
   http://www.mame.net/zips/mame096s.zip
   http://www.mame.net/zips/dmame96s.zip
   http://www.zektor.com/zvg/downloads/dvm81s.zip
   http://www.mame.net/zips/csdpmi5b.zip  (Only 'CWSDPMI.EXE' is needed)

Start by installing DJGPP:

   There are two ways to install DJGPP:
   
   1) Unzip 'djgpp-gcc343.zip' into a temporary directory.

      From the above temporary directory type 'install'. This will setup
      the GCC compiler and associated libraries needed for DOS MAME, include
      the ZVG library. 
   
      You can now delete the temporary directory, and all its files.

      The compiler will reside at 'C:\DJGPP'.
      You will need to add 'C:\DJGPP\BIN' to your path.
      
   or...
      
   2) Copy the directory "djgpp" from the ZVG CD to "C:\djgpp" on your hardrive
      and add "C:\DJGPP\BIN" to your path (in the file AUTOEXEC.BAT).
      
   
Install the MAME source files for DOS MAME:

   Copy directory '\mame096s' to a destination on your hard drive, something
   like "C:\mame096s".
   
   This directory contains a pre-compiled version of DVMAME.EXE.

Use MAKE to re-compile DVMAME.EXE

   From your DVMAME destination directory ('C:\mame096s' in the above example),
   type:

      make MAMEOS=msdos TARGET=vmame

   Case is important.  Assuming everything intalled correctly this will create
   a tiny compile of MAME that includes only the Vector Games.

   If diskspace is critical (maybe you're loading DVMAME.EXE from a compactflash
   card), use UPX to compress DVMAME.EXE:

      upx -9 dvmame.exe

Add the support .EXE files

   Copy the file 'CWSDPMI.EXE' into the same directory as DVMAME.EXE.

   Unzip 'vmenu01a.zip' into the same directory as DVMAME.EXE.
   
Setting up the configuration file for the ZVG.

   To create a default configuration file type:

      dvmame -cc

   Now edit the file MAME.CFG and set:

      frameskip = no
      soundcard = ?            (Set to whatever type of sound card you are using)
      zvg = 2                  (or 1 or 3)
      zvg_artwork = yes
      zvg_overlay = yes
      zvg_menu = yes           (YES if you plan on using 'vm_menu', else set to NO)
      skip_disclaimer = yes
      skip_gameinfo = yes
      rompath = ????           (Set to directory used to store your ROM files)
      samplepath = ????        (Set to directory used to store your SAMPLE files)

   I also prefer:

      stretch = no

That's it!
